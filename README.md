# A persistently low level of atmospheric oxygen in Earth's middle age

This GitHub repository includes Google Earth Engine (GEE) python/JavaScript scripts for calculating river ice and projecting future ice condition, R scripts for importing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
The code used to analyse and visualize the dataset can be accessed online from figshare (link). The figures 2 and 3 in the paper were made using R statistical software (http://www.R-project.org/).

# Overview
Data and code to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript, 
"A persistently low level of atmospheric oxygen in Earth's middle age". 
Data includes publicly-available weather data in addition to primary temperature logger data from instruments deployed underwater in the Farasan Banks region of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea. 
The code does the following analyses: 
(1) compares in situ temperature logger data to satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST), 
(2) tests which SST product works best to reproduce the spatial and temporal patterns in the temperature loggers, 
(3) compares wind and sea surface height (SSH) patterns to the timing of upwelling events,
(4) assesses the broader climate drivers of upwelling (e.g. monsoon winds). 
All figures included in the manuscript are reproduced here.

# Setting up the development environment:

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The scripts requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

The developmental version of the scripts has been tested on the following systems:
Windows 10

The CRAN package should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

Before setting up program testing environment, users should have `R` version 3.4.0 or higher, and several packages set up from CRAN.
# Installation Guide
#### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Windows 10

the latest version of R can be installed by following the guilds below:

1. Download R from http://cran.us.r-project.org/.
2. Click on Download R for Windows. Click on base. Click on Download R 3.3.2 for Windows (or a newer version that appears).
3. Install R. Leave all default settings in the installation options.

4. Install RStudio requires R 3.0.1+.

5. Download RStudio Desktop for windows from http://rstudio.org/download/desktop (it should be called something like RStudio Desktop 1.3.1093 â€” Windows Vista/7/8/10). Choose default installation options.
6. Open RStudio. 
(If you want to learn how to install packages, you can see find some tutorials from the following site or from some books:
https://towardsdatascience.com/setup-a-data-science-environment-on-your-personal-computer-6ce931113914).

total setup time depending on your personal computer system 
but usually should install within about 10 minues.


## Development Version

### Package dependencies

Users should install the following packages prior to installing `lolR`, from an `R` terminal:

```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'abind', 'irlba', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'latex2exp', 'MASS', 'randomForest'))
```

which will install in about 30 seconds on a machine with the recommended specs.

The `lolR` package functions with all packages in their latest versions as they appear on `CRAN` on December 13, 2017. Users can check [CRAN snapshot](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine/) for details. The versions of software are, specifically:
```
abind_1.4-5
latex2exp_0.4.0
ggplot2_2.2.1
irlba_2.3.1
Matrix_1.2-3
MASS_7.3-47
randomForest_4.6-12
```

If you are having an issue that you believe to be tied to software versioning issues, please drop us an [Issue](https://github.com/neurodata/lol/issues). 

### Package Installation

From an `R` session, type:

```
require(devtools)
install_github('neurodata/lol', build_vignettes=TRUE, force=TRUE)  # install lol with the vignettes
require(lolR)
vignette("lol", package="lolR")  # view one of the basic vignettes
```

The package should take approximately 40 seconds to install with vignettes on a recommended computer. 

# Demo

## Functions

For interactive demos of the functions, please check out the vignettes built into the package. They can be accessed as follows:

```
require(lolR)
vignette('lol')
vignette('pca')
vignette('cpca')
vignette('lrcca')
vignette('mdp')
vignette('xval')
vignette('qoq')
vignette('simulations')
vignette('nearestCentroid')
```

## Extending the lolR Package

The lolR package makes many useful resources available (such as embedding and cross-validation) for simple extension. 

To extend the lolR package, check out the vignettes:

```
require(lolR)
vignette('extend_embedding')
vignette('extend_classification')
```

# Results

In this [benchmark comparison](http://docs.neurodata.io/lol/lol-paper/figures/real_data.html), we show that LOL does better than all linear embedding techniques in supervised HDLSS settings when dimensionality is high (d > 100, ntrain <= d) on 20 benchmark problems from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and [PMLB](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks) datasets. LOL provides a good tradeoff between maintaining the class conditional difference (good misclassification rate) in a small number of dimensions (low number of embedding dimensions).
