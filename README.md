# A persistently low level of atmospheric oxygen in Earth's middle age

This GitHub repository includes R scripts(also accessed online from figshare http://10.6084/m9.figshare.13114379) for importing, analyzing, and visualizing the data using R statistical software (http://www.R-project.org/).

# Overview
This GitHub repository includes R scripts to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript, 
"A persistently low level of atmospheric oxygen in Earth's middle age". 
Datasets includes publicly-available weather data in addition to primary temperature logger data from instruments deployed underwater in the Farasan Banks region of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea. The datasets used in this paper are available upon request. 


The code does the following analyses: 
(1) compares in situ temperature logger data to satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST), 
(2) tests which SST product works best to reproduce the spatial and temporal patterns in the temperature loggers, 
(3) compares wind and sea surface height (SSH) patterns to the timing of upwelling events,
(4) assesses the broader climate drivers of upwelling (e.g. monsoon winds). 
All figures included in the manuscript are reproduced here.
The figures 2 and 3 in the paper "A persistently low level of atmospheric oxygen in Earth's middle age" were made using R statistical software (http://www.R-project.org/).

# Repo Contents

- [R](./R): `R` package code.
- [docs](./docs): package documentation, and usage of the `lolR` package on many real and simulated data examples.
- [man](./man): package manual for help in R session.
- [tests](./tests): `R` unit tests written using the `testthat` package.
- [vignettes](./vignettes): `R` vignettes for R session html help pages.


# System Requirements
## OS Requirements
The developmental version of the scripts has been tested on the Windows 10 systems. 
The scripts should be compatible with Mac, and Linux operating systems because it has used R packages.

### Hardware Requirements
The scripts requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

### Software Requirements


Before setting up program testing environment, users should have `R` version 3.4.0 or higher, and several packages set up from CRAN.
# Installation Guide
### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Windows 10

the latest version of R can be installed by following the guilds below:

1. Download R from http://cran.us.r-project.org/.
2. Click on Download R for Windows. Click on base. Click on Download R 3.3.2 for Windows (or a newer version that appears).
3. Install R. Leave all default settings in the installation options.

4. Install RStudio requires R 3.0.1+.

5. Download RStudio Desktop for windows from http://rstudio.org/download/desktop (it should be called something like RStudio Desktop 1.3.1093 â€” Windows Vista/7/8/10). Choose default installation options.
6. Open RStudio. 
(If you want to learn how to install packages, you can see find some tutorials from the following site or from some books:
https://towardsdatascience.com/setup-a-data-science-environment-on-your-personal-computer-6ce931113914).

total setup time depending on your personal computer system and familar with the R software,
but usually should install within about 10 minues.


### Package dependencies

Users should install the following packages prior to using these scripts:

```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'quantreg', 'dplyr', 'tidyverse'))
```

which will install in about 20 seconds on a machine with the recommended specs.


If you are having an issue that you believe to be tied to software versioning issues, please drop us an [Issue](https://github.com/neurodata/lol/issues). 



# Demo
## Instructions to run on data

```
#Loading the dependence packages
library(quantreg)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

#define a workstation
workstation='C:\\Workstation\\XiaomingLiu\\'

# loading the compar dataset
#give the file path of the dataset prepared
csvfile=paste(workstation,'Ce_DataVersion3.csv',sep='')

#read the csv file and get the dataframe
CeDataFrame <- read_csv(csvfile)
```





The R script file named "R_ScriptForFigure3.txt" is used to reproduce the Figure 3 in this paper.

# Instructions for use
### Figure 2 quick example
The R script file named "R_ScriptForFigure2.txt" is used to reproduce the Figure 2 in this paper.
The script has add very detialed comments for almost each line of the code and please check out the code into the R script.
